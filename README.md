# Audio Art Designer

This is a generative art project created in Processing that translates the properties of an audio file into a visual representation. The code analyzes the amplitude and frequency of the audio in real-time to generate shapes, colors, and motion.

## Description

This project is the practical application of the core idea discussed in my personal essay: exploring the intersection of art, technology, and human perception. It is an attempt to answer the question, "Can we translate the experience of sound into a visual medium?"

## How to Run

1.  Download both the `Audio_Art_Designer.pde` file and the `.mp3` file.
2.  Place them in the same folder.
3.  Open the `Audio_Art_Designer.pde` file using the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download ).
4.  Ensure the "Minim" audio library is installed (In Processing: Sketch > Import Library > Add Library... > Search for "Minim").
5.  Run the sketch.

Pressing the 's' key will save a high-resolution screenshot of the current frame.
